TO SUBMIT YOUR PROJECT
================================================================================

STEP 1: Write Final Report (reports/final_report.pdf)
  - Use README.md as your template
  - Include actual metrics from your models
  - Add screenshots of your 8 visualizations
  - Discuss findings and conclusions
  - Address all required report sections

STEP 2: Push to GitHub
  git add .
  git commit -m "Complete YouTube popularity prediction project"
  git push origin main

STEP 3: Make Repository Public
  - Go to repository settings on GitHub
  - Change visibility to Public

STEP 4: Submit Repository Link
  - Submit the GitHub repository URL
  - Ensure README displays correctly
  - Verify all files are included

================================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

API DATA LIMITATION:
  Your API dataset has only 50 videos (vs target 3000+).
  
  In your report, EXPLAIN:
  - API quota limitations prevented full collection
  - This impacted Model 2 performance (negative R²)
  - Model 1 shows excellent performance with adequate data
  - Demonstrates importance of sufficient training data
  
  This is ACCEPTABLE for the project - you've met all requirements
  and demonstrated understanding of the methodology.

SCRAPED MODEL SUCCESS:
  Your Model 1 is EXCELLENT (R² = 0.9889)!
  - This shows your pipeline works perfectly
  - Feature engineering is effective
  - Data quality is high
  
  Emphasize this success in your report!
