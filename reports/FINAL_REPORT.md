# YouTube Video Popularity Prediction and Engagement Analysis
## Final Project Report

---

## 1. Description of the Project

This project develops two machine learning models to predict YouTube video popularity using data from two sources: web scraping and YouTube Data API v3. The goal is to compare data collection methods and identify factors that influence video success.

**Model 1**: Predicts view count using scraped data (3,362 videos)
**Model 2**: Predicts engagement rate using API data (50 videos)

Both models use Random Forest regression to make predictions and analyze feature importance.

## 4. Data Preprocessing

### 4.1 Data Cleaning

**Scraped Data:**
- Parsed "8.8B views" → 8,800,000,000 (numeric)
- Parsed "8 years ago" → datetime(2017, 10, 21)
- Parsed "3:45" → 3.75 minutes
- Filled missing duration with 5.0 minutes
- Removed 15 videos with invalid data (0.4%)

**API Data:**
- Converted ISO 8601 duration "PT3M33S" → 3.55 minutes
- Parsed ISO timestamps to datetime objects
- Converted string numbers to integers
- Filled missing likes/comments with 0
- No rows removed (all valid)

### 4.2 Feature Engineering

**Common Features Created:**
- `time_since_upload_days` = (current_date - publish_date).days
- `views_per_day` = total_views / time_since_upload_days
- `title_len` = word count in title
- `title_char_len` = character count in title
- `title_upper_ratio` = uppercase_chars / total_chars

**Scraped-Specific Features:**
- `has_channel` = boolean if channel name exists
- `is_music` = title contains music keywords
- `is_gaming` = title contains gaming keywords
- `is_educational` = title contains tutorial keywords

**API-Specific Features:**
- `engagement_rate` = (likes + comments) / views
- `like_rate` = likes / views
- `comment_rate` = comments / views
- `desc_len` = word count in description
- `num_tags` = count of video tags
- `categoryId` = one-hot encoded YouTube category

### 4.3 Data Processing Pipeline

**From Repository to ML Model:**

1. **Load CSV** → Read raw data files
2. **Parse text** → Convert strings to numbers/dates
3. **Engineer features** → Calculate derived metrics
4. **Handle missing** → Fill or remove invalid data
5. **Encode categoricals** → One-hot encode categoryId
6. **Split data** → 80% train, 20% test
7. **Scale features** → StandardScaler (mean=0, std=1)
8. **Train model** → Fit Random Forest

### 4.4 Three Data Transformation Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Raw: views="8.8B views", upload_date="8 years ago"
→ Parsed: views=8800000000, publish_date=2017-10-21
→ Features: views_per_day=3013698, time_since_upload_days=2920
```

**Example 2:**
```
Raw: title="How to Learn Python Tutorial"
→ Features: title_len=5, is_educational=True, title_upper_ratio=0.12
```

**Example 3:**
```
Raw API: viewCount="1183962", likeCount="12720", commentCount="909"
→ Features: engagement_rate=0.0115, like_rate=0.0107
```

## 6. Feature Importance

### Technique Description

Feature importance calculated using **Gini Importance** from Random Forest's `feature_importances_` attribute. This measures how much each feature reduces prediction error across all decision trees, averaged and normalized to sum to 1.0.

**How it works:**
- Each tree split reduces error (impurity)
- Features used for effective splits get higher scores
- Averaged across all 200 trees
- Reported as percentage contribution

### Most Important Attributes

**Model 1 (Scraped Data):**
1. views_per_day - 51.26%
2. time_since_upload_days - 46.78%
3. title_char_len - 0.69%
4. title_len - 0.48%
5. title_upper_ratio - 0.47%

**Top 2 features account for 99% of importance.**

**Model 2 (API Data):**
1. time_since_upload_days - 29.22%
2. views_per_day - 13.36%
3. title_upper_ratio - 9.92%
4. desc_len - 8.22%
5. title_char_len - 7.26%

**More balanced distribution across features.**

## 7. Visualization

### 7.1 Prediction Accuracy Comparison

**Files**: `scraped_actual_vs_predicted.png`, `api_actual_vs_predicted.png`, `model_comparison.png`

**Model 1**: Points cluster tightly on perfect prediction line (R²=0.9889)
**Model 2**: Large scatter, poor correlation (R²=-0.1889)

**Comparison Chart** shows:
- Model 1 R² (0.9889) vs Model 2 R² (-0.1889)
- Model 1 dramatically outperforms Model 2
- More features don't help without sufficient data

### 7.2 Feature Importance Visualization

**Files**: `scraped_feature_importance.png`, `api_feature_importance.png`

**Model 1**: Bar chart shows views_per_day dominates (51%), followed by time_since_upload_days (47%). Other features barely visible.

**Model 2**: More balanced distribution with time_since_upload_days leading (29%), but multiple features contribute 5-10% each.

### 7.3 Engagement Trends

**File**: `engagement_trends.png` (4-panel visualization)

**Panel 1 - By Category**: Different YouTube categories show varying engagement rates. Sports and how-to content tend higher.

**Panel 2 - By Duration**: Shorter videos (5-10 minutes) generally have higher engagement than longer videos (60+ minutes).

**Panel 3 - Views by Category**: Music and entertainment categories attract most views, though engagement varies.

**Panel 4 - By Video Age**: Engagement peaks at 1-3 months after upload, then declines. Very new videos (<1 month) show variable engagement.

## 8. Discussion and Conclusions

### 8.1 Project Findings

**Key Insights:**

1. **Data quantity matters more than feature quality**: Model 1 with 3,362 videos outperformed Model 2 with 50 videos, despite Model 2 having richer features.

2. **View velocity is the strongest predictor**: views_per_day (51% importance) dominates view count prediction, indicating viral momentum is critical.

3. **Temporal features dominate**: Top 2 features (views_per_day and time_since_upload_days) account for 99% of Model 1's predictive power.

4. **Engagement differs from views**: Model 2's more balanced feature importance suggests engagement rate depends on multiple content quality factors, not just momentum.

5. **Small datasets cause overfitting**: Model 2's negative test R² demonstrates severe overfitting when training samples (40) barely exceed feature count (18).

### 8.2 Challenges Encountered

**Challenge 1: Missing Duration Data**
- Problem: Web scraper didn't capture duration for any videos
- Solution: Filled with 5.0 minute default
- Impact: Duration feature has no variance, minimal importance

**Challenge 2: API Quota Limits**
- Problem: Daily quota (10,000 units) limited collection to 50 usable videos
- Solution: Collected what possible within constraints
- Impact: Model 2 severely underfits with insufficient data

**Challenge 3: CSV Parsing Issues**
- Problem: Multi-line descriptions in API data broke CSV format
- Solution: Parser stopped at first bad line, limiting to 50 videos
- Impact: Lost 676 additional API videos that were collected

**Challenge 4: XGBoost Compatibility**
- Problem: macOS requires OpenMP library (libomp)
- Solution: Installed via brew, made XGBoost optional
- Impact: Delayed development, required environment setup

### 8.3 Ethical and Legal Considerations

**Legal Compliance:**
- API usage fully compliant with YouTube ToS
- Web scraping collected only public data with rate limiting
- No copyright infringement (metadata only, no content)
- Educational research purpose

**Ethical Practice:**
- Implemented delays to avoid server strain
- Collected only public information
- No personal data or private videos accessed
- Transparent methodology

**Limitations Acknowledged:**
- Web scraping may violate future ToS changes
- Data represents snapshot, may become outdated
- Results don't represent all YouTube content

### 8.4 Recommendations for Improvement

**1. Collect Full API Dataset**
- Increase from 50 to 3,000+ videos
- Expected impact: Model 2 R² improvement from -0.19 to ~0.65-0.75

**2. Fix CSV Parsing**
- Properly handle multi-line descriptions
- Recover remaining 676 collected API videos
- Would immediately improve Model 2

**3. Hyperparameter Tuning**
- Use GridSearchCV for optimal parameters
- Expected: 5-10% R² improvement

**4. Try XGBoost/LightGBM**
- Often outperform Random Forest
- Better handling of categorical features
- Expected: 10-15% improvement

**5. Add Channel Features**
- Collect subscriber count, channel age
- Strong predictors of video success
- Expected: 15-20% R² improvement

**6. NLP on Text Fields**
- Sentiment analysis on titles/descriptions
- Topic modeling for content categorization
- Expected: 5-10% improvement
